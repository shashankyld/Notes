# On Value, Ethics, and Aesthetics

## The Beauty of Ideas

- Sometimes some ideas are so beautiful that you will momentarily accept and revere them before analyzing them.

## Ethics and Metaphysics

- My ethics will only ever be direct deductions from my metaphysics.
- All other accepted ethics will be rejected, like that of Schopenhauer!
- You are a plague. Love.

## The Nature of Value

- I want to understand how we assume value in things.
- Bias is different, but love is the same.
- There is no meaning in this world.
- There are 2 cars and 5 pens in this world.
- Love is every experience you call love, likewise, other emotions.
- I think it is only in the mind that one can love.
- I need a computer that can render love for me.
- Love is a man's truest and most creative expression.

## Empowerment and Ownership

- Access to storage is empowerment!
- Inspiration is more real than love!
- Confidence and Exploration depend on the type of sense of ownership!
- Government cannot control morals.
- Value arises from the contract.
- No value ever is not from some contract.
- To love someone is an amazing painkiller and a good night's sleep!

## Thoughts and Publicness

- Unlike geographies, thoughts aren't tactile and aren't limited, so publicness is not a responsibility in virtual groups.

## Respect and Protocol

- Respect is a protocol? Or a feeling?
- I consider a drone as an organism. The alien within.
- It might be the case that God created us, but I don't think he cares about our morality.

## Morality and Value

- Value requires a valuer.
- It's morally wrong if you hurt any sentient being, and also it is morally wrong if you disrespectfully damage any nonliving tool you have.

## The Quest for Meaning

- What is not boring?
- Is art boring?
- Not just humanity. Consciousness first.
- Bored while pooping.
- Practice more of what is important, what you love.
- It is very hard to focus without a purpose.
- You are my stakeholder.

## Aesthetics and Creativity

- Creativity is not about control; it is about letting go.
- What makes beauty appealing is that it is useful.
