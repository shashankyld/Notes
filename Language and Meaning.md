## On Language and Meaning

### Language as Action

I consider every word I utter and every sentence I write equivalent to any other action I perform, like walking and kicking a bag. I do not care how people understand my thoughts; I only deeply care about how accurately language can represent my thoughts. It, which I care about, is a problem of my own. A probabilistic trust model is peaceful for the mind.

### Visual Imagination and Abstractions

Every visual imagination is preceded by a sentence/word formation. For example, imagine a laughing carrot. Language is just complicated action. Language, like light, is a physical stimulus. What we make out of it are abstractions.

### Love for Language

I have an unbearable love for language and meaning. I feel it now as I form sentences. I deeply desire to engage in conversations, conversations that never happened. Philosophy exists in the language space, and hence, a philosopher should first understand language.

### Language's Nature

Language is applied and probabilistic. One needs more phrases to narrow down to a meaning/object that the set of phrases (or what the thinker) identifies. We see a color! No! We just experience a color! A color is just an EM wave, a precursor, a cause of the experience which we call color.

### On Good and Evil

Good and Evil are just categories, and they don't have meaning at all. The totality of facts. I think we rely a lot on language to propagate and represent knowledge. The reality "continues" to exist. I think solutions to problems of love, philosophy, and truth can be found by understanding language!

### Meaning and Interpretation

All meaning comes with language and signs! There are no facts, only interpretations! A fact is a language sentence and hence only a representation. Fact Vs Reality. Learn your language game's rules! Language is the most important part of my life. Language is the world. Choice of words merely endorses thoughts. But they dictate the direction of the message.

### Paradoxes and Clarity

Paradoxes are problems of the language, not reality. Language is not blind. The last thing is clarity. This world is just language and logic. Minds are private, not their expressions to the world. People project their meaning into texts.

## My Philosophy on Logic and Competition
Bachelors are unmarried.
Macro is a thinking style.
Nothing is original except the whole!
Is reasoning necessary if there is only a single being?
Is logic the same in all simulations?
The idea is to out-philosophize others.
