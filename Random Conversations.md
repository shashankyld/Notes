## On idol worship

**Shashank:** Why do you believe in God?

**Endri:** What's the reason for you to not believe in Him?

**Shashank:** Because people created these gods that Hindus or any other religions pray.

**Endri:** I don't want to say anything on this. I think everyone has their own perception. But what my experience says is that there is a divine power which is above everyone. You can call it God or Universe.

**Shashank:** Do you feel uncomfortable talking about the validity of religious beliefs? But, the universe doesn't seem to care about people's prayers. Empirically, there is no evidence that prayers change the world in any sense! Maybe it does at the individual's psychological level! But, it means it is no better than a placebo! So, I think there is no God.

## KiteWarriorsofYellandu

In the town of Yellandu, there was a tradition that filled the skies with vibrant colors and echoed with the cheers of children. It was the season of Sankranti, and in Yellandu, that meant one thing â€“ kite flying.

Every year, as the sun danced in the clear blue sky, children of all ages would gather on the dusty streets, clutching their prized kites. Kites of all sizes were up for grabs, from the humble 2-rupee wonders to the mighty 50-rupee giants that towered over the kids like skyscrapers. It was the year 2010, and I was just a 12-year-old with dreams as big as the sky itself.

The heart of our kite-flying adventures was a tall water tank that overlooked our town. Most kids stayed away from it, but it was a different story for the older folks, aged 22 to 26, who had just graduated from engineering. They were the legends of our street, the fierce kite warriors who could cut a kite a kilometer away, thanks to their commanding view of the entire town.

The victory cry "kaate" echoed through the streets whenever a kite was successfully cut. It was the sweetest sound in the world for us kids, and our greatest dream was to one day join those engineering graduates on top of the water tank and become part of their elite league.

Kite fighting in Yellandu was more than just flying kites; it was an art form. We used different kinds of threads like "saada," "maanja," and "tangoose," each with its own unique strategy and tactics.

One fateful day, those engineering grads decided to fly the largest kite the town had ever seen. Its massive presence darkened the sky, and every child in the street yearned to be the one to cut it down. With a mere touch and the incredible tension in the big kite's thread, they effortlessly defeated anyone who dared challenge them.

But then, something unexpected happened. Srikanth, a small boy from our street, even younger than me, decided to take on the giants. The wind was on his side that day, and he skillfully let his kite soar higher and faster, maintaining the tension in his thread. With sheer determination, he maneuvered his kite above the colossal one and employed a special technique known as "deel" to cut it loose.

A jubilant roar erupted from every corner of the street, and the triumphant cry of "kaate" filled the air as if we had all been part of Srikanth's incredible feat. Everyone was ecstatic, except for me. I had wanted my chance at that magnificent kite, to capture it and hold it in my hands, but it was too high and distant, drifting away into the endless Yellandu sky.

And so, in the tales of Yellandu, Srikanth's victory became a legendary chapter, a testament to the indomitable spirit of a young boy who dared to dream big and reached for the skies. In our little town, where dreams took flight on the wings of kites, we learned that sometimes, the smallest among us could achieve the greatest victories.
