One of my core motivations for pursuing robotics lies in the recognition that humans are often tasked with dangerous, repetitive, and mundane activitiesâ€”a practice that may not be sustainable in the future. 
Robots, with their capacity for efficiency and safety, excel in such domains. As I aspire to delve deeper into the fields of robotics and language models, my desire to earn a Ph.D. stems from the belief that, 
post my master's degree, it may be challenging to secure a position that enables me to engage in the kind of research and exploration I am passionate about.

I view a five-year Ph.D. program as an invaluable opportunity to validate my convictions and enhance my understanding of these research areas. 
It offers the time and resources required to delve into the intricacies of this field, conduct experiments, and generate meaningful contributions. 
Despite the lower remuneration associated with Ph.D. pursuits, my unwavering motivation to partake in this research endeavor remains evident.

As a testament to my commitment, my academic background spans mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree, followed by a master's at UniBonn Geodetic Engineering(Mobile Sensing and Robotics) 
under the guidance of Prof.Cyrill Stachniss, Prof.Lasse, and Prof.Jens Behley, . This educational journey allowed me to delve into the mathematics underpinning SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). 
While I have acquired a solid foundation in SLAM concepts, I am resolute in my ambition to progress further. The next phase involves constructing more comprehensive world models, leveraging additional information, and refining the representation of maps.

In light of these aspirations, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. It represents the ideal pathway for me to continue my journey of research and innovation.

From an early age, the researcher has held a strong fascination with images, especially 3D and 360-degree images, which has driven a continued interest 
in exploring the world modeling capabilities of SLAM. During the researcher's bachelor's studies, they utilized drones and open-source tools to map environments. 
This endeavor revealed that SLAM technology underpins 3D imaging and mapping, making it a central area of interest. The core motivation behind this 
research proposal is the aspiration to create a robust world model that effectively integrates both visual and linguistic data.

## Research Goals:
The primary aim of this research is to investigate and develop techniques that seamlessly combine visual information from 3D imaging with language models 
to enrich world modeling capabilities in the field of SLAM and robotics. Specifically, the goals are as follows:

    Enhancing World Modeling: Explore how language models can be integrated into SLAM algorithms to provide robots with an enriched understanding of their environment, including semantics, object recognition, and contextual information.

    Efficient Navigation: Investigate how language models can assist in more efficient and context-aware robot navigation, contributing to safer and more intelligent robotic systems.

    Human-Robot Interaction: Examine how language can be employed as a natural interface for human-robot interaction, enabling users to communicate with robots in everyday language and receive meaningful responses.

    Data Augmentation: Explore the potential of using language models to generate synthetic data that can be used to augment training datasets for SLAM and robotic applications, improving the adaptability and performance of robot systems.

## Methodology:
The research will employ a combination of techniques from computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. This will involve the integration of state-of-the-art language models 
into existing SLAM algorithms to facilitate comprehensive world modeling. Experimental setups will include data collection with 3D imaging devices and the analysis of how language can be 
incorporated into SLAM processes for enhanced perception and decision-making.

## Conclusion:
The proposed research seeks to bridge the domains of language models, 3D imaging, and SLAM to create more intelligent and context-aware robotic systems. By addressing the outlined goals, 
this research aims to contribute to the development of innovative applications in robotics, enabling robots to construct more comprehensive and semantically rich world models. 
This, in turn, will result in more intelligent, adaptive, and user-friendly robotic systems.

The motivation behind this research is deeply rooted in the researcher's passion for exploring the world through images and 3D imaging, and the desire to integrate language models as a fundamental component of world modeling in the field of robotics.

Im no sure if at the PreDoc role Ill work on problems that scale to a billion people. But, I think atleast the team there have a thought process that values problems and research areas that scale. I believe robotics is a big deal! 
Chance to work with people of complimentary skills - NLP, Economics, Social Sciences,... 
Focus on learning, dont need to know everything already - but needs a mind of research.
Publsihing 3 papers meant nothing - learning to do the research the right way. Deafult mode is to look at the latest paper and try to improve it!
Take a longer term view - 2 years of rapid learning - can improve chances of producing better results in PhD later - satisfaction
Work on Embodied AI, Google is the best company in the world. 
I think I can bring the SLAM way of doing things. I want to find opportunities in India, I love India more.
Combining SLAM/Probablistic Robotics Thooery with Learning and Background knowledge of large llms, vlms.
Its the ability to work on robotics and AI in India that matters the most. I had to come to Germany to study SLAM theory and Robotics. To do the same kind of work in India and at a company like Google is a game changer. 
Googliness. Google Research addresses challenges that define the technology of today and tomorrow. From conducting fundamental research to influencing product development, our research teams have the opportunity to impact technology used by billions of people every day. 
Recording my labour of cleaning dishes (100 hr dataset) - so one day I can use that to train a robot.
Dr. Manish Gupta is the Director of Google Research India - said - this program teaches the right way to do research. maybe I can learn from that before joining a PhD. This is the best opportunity I can get right now.
I wrote an article or a small proof "In defence of shape priors" to defend the usage of deep shape priors - i.e. DeepSDF for cars. TO help optimize the bounding box poses in the self driving scenario. I am profoundly happy when I see it mathematically - the reasoning - just by using simple simple bayes rule. 
In some sense, we are updating our belief about the bounding box pose by grounding provided by shape priors to fit the point cloud, shape, and the bounding box perfectly.
I really loved Probablistic Robotics after joining my master in mobile sensing and robotics at UniBonn. And the fact that a neural network can represent a class of shapes like cars, chairs, and other house hold objects just blows my mind. I would like to work on robots that can do my chores, I strongly feel 
Deep learning methods will play a great role, but I also strongly believe that probablistic robotics can give us some unique insights on the directions we can take in our research. I enjoy writing equations, I was in an assumption that Google Research, India doesnt work on Robotics, but when I saw this paper: A Contextual Bandit Approach for Learning to Plan in Environments with Probabilistic Goal Configurations - I felt good. I am not sure if I will be on a  robotics team 100% of my working hours, but the opportunity itself is amazing. 
I spent most of my bachelors in the aeromodelling club, at that time, it was just like a hobby club with robotics competitions. So, I joined IHFC, where I tried to do mapping with drones, but I found my self puzzling about small concepts - I decided I had to take a masters degree and learn robotics from ground up. Theory to Practical. I found Prof Cyrill Stachniss and was really lucky to get into his robotics program and also a job at the photogrammetry lab. I want to continue, I am now good at the classical way of doing robotics, but now there is a surge is deep learning methods in many aspects of robotics like map representations with neural implicit maps... My Master thesis was an entry for me into this. I also took NLP, Parallel Programming and Explainable AI courses - just so I go in the direction that the today and tomorrow of the robotics are heading. I really consider this chance with ultimate importance. To emphasize again - to do exciting stuff in robotics  and to do it at google and in India is an extraodinary opportunity. I can use the 2 years of this program to the fullest
