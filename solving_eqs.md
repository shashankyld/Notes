## Overview

This README provides a guide on how to solve a system of nonlinear equations in Python using the Newton-Raphson method. You can use this as a reference in your GitHub repository.

## Steps to Solve a Nonlinear System of Equations

1. **Define Your System of Equations:**

   Start by defining your system of equations. For example, consider a system of two equations with two unknowns:
```
f1(x, y) = 2x^2 + y^2 - 1
f2(x, y) = x^2 + 4y^2 - 4
```

2. **Implement the Equations:**

Implement each equation as a separate Python function. Here's an example:

```python
def f1(x, y):
    return 2*x**2 + y**2 - 1

def f2(x, y):
    return x**2 + 4*y**2 - 4
```
3. **Use the Newton-Raphson Method:**


You can use the Newton-Raphson method or another suitable iterative method to find the solution. Here's an example using the SciPy library:
```
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

# Define a function that returns the system of equations
def equations(vars):
    x, y = vars
    eq1 = f1(x, y)
    eq2 = f2(x, y)
    return [eq1, eq2]

# Initial guess for the solution
initial_guess = [0.0, 0.0]

# Solve the system of equations
solution = fsolve(equations, initial_guess)

# Print the solution
print("Solution:", solution)
```
