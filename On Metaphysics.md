# Metaphysical

## Foundational Knowledge

- Metaphysics is the presumption from which you derive all other studies!
- Maybe I am just mechanical.
- God is a waste of time.
- Philosophy is mental work.

## The Nature of Thought

- Thinking is Hallucinating, and Hallucinating is Thinking.
- In retrospect, everything was a metaphor.
- Who picks the random?
- Resistance is your true self.

## The Power of Ideas

- Ideas infect!
- Some phenomena are explained by cause, and some by purpose!
- All prophets fail.

## The Abstract World of Thoughts

- Unlike geographies, thoughts aren't tactile and aren't limited.
- So publicness is not a responsibility in virtual groups.
- I can decide what to write, so I have free will. Can I be wrong here?

## Manipulation of Knowledge

- Manipulating knowledge (let's say thinking) is indirectly manipulating some physical system.
- Traveling through space, time, and memories.
- Imagine food with morally bad taste.

## A Perspective on Reality

- Particles are the Objects, Forces are the Plugins, and World as a Simulation.
- Properties of "I" are too local and temporal for it to be eternal and independent of physical nature.
- Thinking is Simulating. Experiencing is Living.

## The Illusion of Self

- There is no "I", There is no "You", We are just hosts of information, ideas, and genes.
- We live in a story that our brain tells itself. Basically, a dream.
- A mirror is a sensor.

## Metaphysical Hypotheses

- Metaphysical Hypothesis: You are a computer. I am a bunch of ideas. I don't have ideas, ideas have me. Some ideas are more viral than others.
- Ideas influence ideas.
- Brains and humans are just containers. Nature, we are.

## Transcending Boundaries

- I am this world. Consciousness transcends time. Little closer to nothingness. Illusions aren't necessarily bad.
- In a simulation, we try to minimize the possibilities so that our computational power will not go short.
- I believe our whole God's systems are simulating entities in clusters, looping individual items' instantiations relatively at times and places closer to their cluster-mates.
- Not who I was, not who I will be. I am is. Space has no grid.
